                        <p>D&amp;D is a tabletop roleplaying game first published by <a href="https://company.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Wizards of the Coast</a> in 1977, and has since evolved into its current 5th edition (5e).</p>
                        <p>The game consists on playing an adventure through the world that a <a href="#section-dm" class="section-link">Dungeon Master</a> presents to the players. You'll explore worlds filled with magic and exciting danger, and hopefully have fun along the way. Whether you derive passion from insightful banter or bone-crushing combat, D&amp;D has something in it for you.</p>

                            <p>Roleplaying is the heart of the game, it's playing as your own character in the world you're exploring. Anything from chatting up an NPC (non-player character) at a tavern to exploring ruinous forests!</p>

                            <p>Some may find the core of the game to be its combat. That's what makes every roleplaying game unique! Test the strength of your party against monsters ranging from kobolds to dragons!</p>
                            <p>Combat involves the more complex facets of the game, and a lot of dice-rolling! But remember, your fate lies with you, be creative, don't let the dice dictate the course of your game.</p>

                            <p>Ability checks allow you to know how well your character does at a given task, say you want to take down a door or pick a lock? Or maybe you want to talk an NPC out of calling the royal guard? Trying to recall what that plant was named?</p>
                            <p>All of those and many more require ability checks, which consist on rolling a d20 and adding the relevant modifier.</p>

                            <p>Saving throws are prompts for a given creature to avoid a hazard they would otherwise be affected by.</p>
                            <p>Think, for instance, avoiding a trap, or dodging out of the way of a beam of fire. Other types of saving throws may include resisting the effect of spells.</p>

                            <p>Attacks are the basic offensive tactic in the game, trying to hit a single enemy with a weapon &mdash; be it melee or ranged &mdash; or a spell will often require an attack.</p>
                            <p>When attacking an enemy, you're trying to beat their Armor Class (or AC) in order to hit.</p>
